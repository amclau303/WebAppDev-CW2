This is a website designed to act as a health and wellbeing application. It provides information about fitness, nutrition and lifestyle.

The main contents of the website are only available after registering.

Once registered, the sidebar will open up various options to the user: fitness, nutrition, lifestyle and an achievement and goal tracker.

The fitness, nutrition and lifestyle pages all feature information about the specific category.

The goal tracker allows the user to track current goals as well as edit, remove or add new ones. There is an attached timestamp as well as a True/False 
option for whether the goal is completed. Complete goals are marked in green.

The achievement page functions the same as the goal page.
